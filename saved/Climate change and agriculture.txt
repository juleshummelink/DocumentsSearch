Global climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes. Climate change can affect agriculture both directly and indirectly. Adverse outcome can come through changes in average temperatures, rainfall, and climate extremes (e.g., heat waves); changes in pests and diseases;[1] changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations; changes in the nutritional quality of some foods;[2] and changes in sea level.[3]

Climate change effects on agriculture are unevenly distributed across the world.[4] Future climate changes will most likely affect crop production in low latitude countries negatively, while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative.[4] Animal husbandry also contributes towards climate change through greenhouse gas emissions.[opinion]

Agriculture contributes towards global warming through anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forests into agricultural land.[5][6] In 2010, agriculture, forestry and land-use change were estimated to contribute 20–25% of global annual emissions.[7] In 2020, the European Union's Scientific Advice Mechanism estimated that the food system as a whole contributed 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions, and that this figure was on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and dietary change.[8]

A range of policies may reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture[9][10] and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector for a more sustainable food system.[11][12][13]

The agricultural sector is a driving force in the gas emissions and land use effects thought to cause climate change. In addition to being a significant user of land and consumer of fossil fuel, agriculture contributes directly to greenhouse gas emissions through practices such as rice production and the raising of livestock;[14] according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the three main causes of the increase in greenhouse gases observed over the past 250 years have been fossil fuels, land use, and agriculture.[15]

The agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.[16][17]

According to the IPCC, it makes up at least 10-12% of emissions, and when there are changes in land due to agricultural cultivation, it can rise as high as 17%. Emissions from farms of nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide make up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of agricultural emissions.[17]

Farm animal digestive systems can be put into two categories: monogastric and ruminant. Ruminant cattle for beef and dairy rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types may yield less emissions. Monogastric animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce as much methane.[17]

There are many strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse gas emissions. Some of these strategies include a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals' eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in both the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.[
