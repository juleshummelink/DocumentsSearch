Climate change mitigation consists of actions to limit global warming and its related effects. This involves reductions in human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) as well as activities that reduce their concentration in the atmosphere.[2] It is one of the ways to respond to climate change, along with adaptation.[3]

When the emissions from land-use changes are excluded, fossil fuel combustion accounts for 89% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and 68% of all GHG emissions.[4] The most important challenge may be to stop burning coal, oil, and gas and use only clean energy. Due to massive price drops, wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) are increasingly out-competing oil, gas and coal[5] though these require energy storage and improved electrical grids. As low-emission energy is deployed at large scale, transport and heating can shift to these mostly electric sources.[6]

Mitigation of climate change may also be achieved by changes in agriculture, transport, forest-management (reforestation and preservation), waste management, buildings, and industrial systems.[7] Methane emissions, which have a high short-term impact, can be targeted by reductions in cattle and meat consumption.

Political and economical responses to date include forms of carbon pricing by carbon taxes and carbon emission trading, reductions of fossil fuel subsidies, making national promises and laws, subsidies, simplified regulations for the integration of low-carbon energy and divestment from fossil fuel finance.

Almost all countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).[8] The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of GHGs at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.[9] In 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed that future global warming should be limited to below 2 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-industrial level.[10] With the Paris Agreement of 2015, this was confirmed.[11]

The current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2 °C despite the limit being economically beneficial globally and to many top GHG emitters such as China and India.[12][13]
The UNFCCC aims to stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.[15] Currently human activities are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it.[14]

In 2018, human activities were estimated to have caused approximately 1.0 °C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8 °C to 1.2 °C.[16]
